This application is a simple calculator app that takes the value of the dispute as input, and outputs the points and lawyer’s reward. As the user inputs the values,
a comma is automatically inserted after each thousand, for easier readability. 
The calculation is based on the layer’s Tariff for Croatia and can be found at this link: http://www.hok-cba.hr/hr/vazeca-tarifa.
